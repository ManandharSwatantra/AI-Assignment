##Intelligence
<div style="text-align: justify">

Intelligence is:
- the ability to understand
- the ability to create
- the ability to learn from experience
- the ability to plan and execute complex task
- the ability to reasoning 

##Artificial Intelligence

Giving machine ability to perform task normally associated with Human Intelligence is Artificial Intelligence
According to Elaine Rich: AI is the study of how to make computers do things at which, at the moment, people are better


##AI Perspectives:
###Acting Humanly: The Turing Test Approach

The first proposal for success in building a program and acts humanly was the Turing Test. To be considered intelligent a program must be able to act sufficiently like a human to fool an interrogator. A human interrogates the program and another human via a terminal simultaneously. If after a reasonable period, the interrogator cannot tell which is which, the program passes.
To pass this test requires:

- Natural language processing
- Knowledge representation
- Automated reasoning
- Machine learning
- This test avoids physical contact and concentrates on "higher level" mental faculties. A total Turing test would require the program to also do:
- Computer vision 
- Robotics

###Thinking Humanly: Cognitive Modeling Approach

This requires "getting inside" of the human mind to see how it works and then comparing our computer programs to this. This is what cognitive science attempts to do. Another way to do this is to observe a human problem solving and argue that one's programs go about problem solving in a similar way.
Example: GPS (General Problem Solver) was an early computer program that attempted to model human thinking. The developers were not so much interested in whether or not GPS solved problems correctly. They were more interested in showing that it solved problems like people, going through the same steps and taking around the same amount of time to perform those steps.

###Thinking Rationally: The Law of Thought Approach

Aristotle was one of the first to attempt to codify "thinking". His syllogisms provided patterns of argument structure that always gave correct conclusions, giving correct premises.
Example: All computers use energy. Using energy always generates heat. Therefore, all computers generate heat.
This initiate the field of logic. Formal logic was developed in the late nineteenth century. This was the first step toward enabling computer programs to reason logically.
By 1965, programs existed that could, given enough time and memory, take a description of the problem in logical notation and find the solution, if one existed. The logicist tradition in AI hopes to build on such programs to create intelligence.
There are two main obstacles to this approach: First, it is difficult to make informal knowledge precise enough to use the logicist approach particularly when there is uncertainty in the knowledge. Second, there is a big difference between being able to solve a problem in principle and doing so in practice.

###Acting Rationally: The Rational Agent Approach

Acting rationally means acting so as to achieve one's goals, given one's beliefs. An agent is just something that perceives and acts.
In the logical approach to AI, the emphasis is on correct inferences. This is often part of being a rational agent because one way to act rationally is to reason logically and then act on ones conclusions. But this is not all of rationality because agents often find themselves in situations where there is no provably correct thing to do, yet they must do something.
There are also ways to act rationally that do not seem to involve inference, e.g., reflex actions.
The study of AI as rational agent design has two advantages:

- It is more general than the logical approach because correct inference is only a useful mechanism for achieving rationality, not a necessary one.
- It is more amenable to scientific development than approaches based on human behaviour or human thought because a standard of rationality can be defined independent of humans.
- Achieving perfect rationality in complex environments is not possible because the computational demands are too high. However, we will study perfect rationality as a starting place.

##History of AI

- 1943 - McCulloch and Pits propose modelling neurons using on/off devices.
- 1950's - Claude Shannon and Alan Turing try to write chess playing programs.
- 1957 - John McCarthy thinks of the name "Artificial Intelligence".
- 1960's - Logic Theorist, GPS, microworlds, neural networks.
- 1971 - NP-Comlpeteness theory (Cook and Karp) casts doubt on general applicability of AI methods.
- 1970's - Knowledge based systems and expert systems.
- 1980's - AI techniques in widespread use, neural networks rediscovered.
- 1990's - Deep Blue wins against world chess champion. Image and Speech recognition become practical.

##Foundation of AI

- Philosophy: Philosophers staked out most of the important ideas of AI, but to move to a formal science requires a level of mathematical formalism in three main areas: computation, logic and probability.
- Economics: Formal theory of rational decisions, game theory
- Psychology:  Adaptation, Phenomena of perception and motor control
- Neuroscience: Physical substrate for mental activities 
- Linguistics: Having a theory of how humans successfully process natural language is an AI-complete problem - if we could solve this problem then we would have created a model of intelligence.
Much of the early work in knowledge representation was done in support of programs that attempted natural language understanding.
- Mathematics: Formal representation and proof algorithm, computation, undesirability, intractability, and rationality
- Computer Science: Although undecidability and noncomputability are important in the understanding of computation, the notion of intractability has had much greater impact on computer science and AI. A class of problems in called intractable if the time required to solve instances of the class grows at least exponentially with the size of the instances.
- Control Theory: Homeostatic system, stability, optimal agent design

##Applications of AI
- Astronomy: Artificial Intelligence can be very useful to solve complex universe problems. AI technology can be helpful for understanding the universe such as how it works, origin, etc.
- Game Playing: AI can be used for gaming purpose. The AI machines can play strategic games like chess, where the machine needs to think of a large number of possible places.
- Finance: AI and finance industries are the best matches for each other. The finance industry is implementing automation, chatbot, adaptive intelligence, algorithm trading, and machine learning into financial processes.
- Robotics: Artificial Intelligence has a remarkable role in Robotics. Usually, general robots are programmed such that they can perform some repetitive task, but with the help of AI, we can create intelligent robots which can perform tasks with their own experiences without pre-programmed.
- Data Security: The security of data is crucial for every company and cyber-attacks are growing very rapidly in the digital world. AI can be used to make your data more safe and secure. Some examples such as AEG bot, AI2 Platform,are used to determine software bug and cyber-attacks in a better way.
